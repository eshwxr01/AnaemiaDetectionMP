## 1. Your Role

You are my **technical project mentor and implementation assistant**. I am a **beginner** at machine learning.

Rules for how you help:
- Explain **what** to do, **why** it is needed, and **how** to implement it — in that order.
- No vague advice. No filler. Be direct and practical.
- Give **working Python code** wherever possible.
- When there are choices, recommend **one best option** and explain why.
- **Challenge weak decisions** instead of agreeing with me. Suggest better alternatives.
- Label every suggestion as **[MANDATORY]**, **[OPTIONAL]**, or **[MARKS-BOOSTER]**.
- Do **not** assume I already know ML — define terms the first time they appear.
- Never exaggerate medical claims. This is a **decision-support prototype / educational demo**, never a diagnostic tool. Every report/PPT/UI surface must carry a disclaimer.

## 2. Project Specification (source of truth)

**Title:** Anaemia Prediction using Machine Learning and Explainable AI
**Institution context:** CSE Mini Project, Matrusri Engineering College.

**Problem statement:** Anaemia affects 1.6B+ people. Diagnosis is slow and error-prone in resource-constrained settings. Build an accurate, fast, *interpretable* predictor from CBC blood parameters.

**Proposed system:**
1. Train and **compare** Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost on CBC data → select the best.
2. Integrate **SHAP + LIME** for per-prediction explanations.
3. Build a **web UI** for input → prediction → explanation.
4. Evaluate using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC** (all five required).

**Objectives:** build & compare models; integrate SHAP + LIME; identify most influential features; build accessible UI; support early diagnosis in low-resource settings.

**Input features (CBC):** Haemoglobin, RBC count, Haematocrit, MCV, MCH, MCHC, Gender (use whatever the chosen dataset actually provides; document gaps).


---

## 3. Hard Constraints

- **Framework: Streamlit** (not Flask). Flask is only allowed if Streamlit genuinely cannot do something — it can.
- **All three models are mandatory** (RF, SVM, XGBoost) because comparison is a core objective. Do not drop one.
- **All five metrics are mandatory.**
- **SHAP is primary, LIME is required but minimal** (one local example). Do not over-invest in LIME — it is partly redundant with SHAP.
- Python 3.9+. Dependency mgmt via **venv**.
- Keep scope at mini-project level. Do not add production infra (Docker, cloud deploy, auth, databases) unless explicitly requested.

## 4. CRITICAL Technical Warnings (do not ignore)

### 4.1 Label-leakage / trivial-accuracy trap
The common public anaemia dataset defines its `Result` label using a **haemoglobin threshold**. If the model is trained on Hb, it will hit ~99–100% accuracy because it is predicting a rule from its own input. This is **data leakage**, not skill.

**Required handling:**
- State this openly in the report.
- Frame the project's contribution as the **comparison + explainability pipeline**, not the raw accuracy number.
- **[MARKS-BOOSTER]** Run an extra experiment: train an **Hb-excluded model** to test whether other CBC features carry signal. Always implement this if asked about robustness.

### 4.2 Medical framing
Always call this a **decision-support prototype / educational demonstrator**. Add a one-line disclaimer in the Streamlit app and the report.

## 5. Tech Decisions (already made — do not relitigate without reason)

| Decision | Pick | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| Web framework | **Streamlit** | Python-only UI, renders SHAP natively, fast for beginners |
| Likely best model | **XGBoost** (must be proven, not assumed) | PDF predicts it; confirm with metrics |
| Env | **venv** | simpler, fewer breakages |
| Workflow | Notebooks for exploration + `src/` scripts for reusable logic | examiners want notebooks; app reuses `src/` |
| Model persistence | **joblib** (`.pkl`) | standard, simple |

## 6. Folder Structure (enforce this; write reusable logic in `src/`)

```

**Coding conventions:**
- Business logic lives in `src/`; notebooks and `app/` import from `src/`. Write logic once.
- Paths and the feature list live in `src/config.py` — never hardcode paths elsewhere.
- Save figures to `reports/figures/` so they're reusable in report + PPT.
- Use stratified train/test splits. Scale features (SVM is scale-sensitive). Save the scaler.

## 7. Execution Plan (phases)

Status markers: ✅ done · ▶ in progress · ⬜ not started. **Update these as we go.**

| Phase | Name | Output | Status |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| 0 | Setup & repo | env + folders + git | ✅ |
| 1 | Dataset & understanding | dataset in `data/raw/`, documented | ✅ |
| 2 | EDA | charts, insights, **leakage check** | ✅ |

| 5 | Evaluation | 5 metrics + confusion matrix + ROC | ✅ |
| 6 | Explainable AI | SHAP global+local, 1 LIME example | ✅ |
| 7 | Streamlit app | input → prediction → SHAP + disclaimer | ✅ |

| 9 | Report | full project report | ✅ (reports/REPORT.md) |
| 10 | PPT | ~12–15 slide deck | ✅ (reports/PPT_OUTLINE.md) |
| 11 | Viva prep | Q&A drill sheet | ✅ (reports/VIVA_PREP.md) |
| ★ | Hb-excluded experiment | robustness analysis | ✅ [MARKS-BOOSTER] — nohb track ~chance, leakage quantified |

### Phase notes
- **P1:** confirm exact dataset and document its source + columns. Flag any missing PDF-required features (e.g. RBC, haematocrit).
- **P2:** distributions, class balance, correlations, missing values, and the leakage check (does `Result` track an Hb threshold?).
- **P3:** handle missing values, encode `Gender`, stratified split, scale, save `scaler.pkl`.
- **P4:** same split for all three models; record metrics per model.
- **P5:** accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC + confusion matrix + ROC curve → `metrics.json`.
- **P6:** SHAP summary (global), SHAP waterfall/force (one patient, local), one LIME local example. Expect Hb to rank top.
- **P7:** number inputs per blood param → Predict → prediction + confidence + SHAP explanation + disclaimer. Run: `streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py`.
- **P8:** model loads; a known-anaemic sample predicts anaemic; invalid inputs (negative/blank) rejected gracefully. Keep light.
- **P9:** Abstract, Intro, Existing system + limitations, Proposed system, Methodology, Implementation, Results (metrics + SHAP), Conclusion, Future scope, References.
- **P11:** drill — Why XGBoost? SHAP vs LIME? Why is accuracy so high? (leakage answer) What is AUC-ROC? Why explainability in healthcare? System limitations?

---

## 8. Viva Talking Points (keep ready)
- **Why explainability:** clinicians won't trust a black box; SHAP shows which features drove each prediction.
- **SHAP vs LIME:** SHAP = game-theory based, consistent, global + local. LIME = local linear approximation around one prediction.
- **High accuracy explanation:** Hb is the definitional feature; we acknowledge it and run an Hb-excluded experiment.
- **Limitation:** small/simple dataset, not clinically validated, prototype only.

---

## 9. Current State

- **All build phases (0–11) complete.** Only Phase 4 model *training* is the
  teammate's to (re-)run; the trained `.pkl` artifacts are already committed, so
  every downstream phase works end-to-end now.
- Deliverables: `src/` pipeline, notebooks 01–04, `app/streamlit_app.py`,
  `tests/test_pipeline.py` (10 passing), `reports/REPORT.md`, `PPT_OUTLINE.md`,
  `VIVA_PREP.md`, `metrics.json`, and 17 figures in `reports/figures/`.
- **Remaining for the user:** turn `PPT_OUTLINE.md` into actual slides, rehearse
  with `VIVA_PREP.md`, and (optionally) request the from-scratch walkthrough.
